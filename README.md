# Bid-on-me
Bit-on-me is an app designed to sync up customers to companies without the annoying frequency of calls that resulted from a service inquiry. One may think of it as an eBay for services; i.e. auto/health insurance, contractor quotes, etc. Users create a post with their current policies or quotes, while remaining anonymous. Companies or bidders, review the customer posting, and if they are able to propose a counter offer, they can leave their information for the user to contact them directly. No longer will a user fill out forms repeatedly for every auto insurance site, then recieve several calls a day for weeks on end.
